# Concept

- World starts pitch black, character is white
- Throughout the world, there are powerups you can pick up. These powersup change the color of your aura and the background, the world changes theme with the complementary color of your aura. Different color = different powerup. 
- When you mix two color powerup auras together, you get a new powerup that is a combination of both. For example, dash powerup + time-stop powerup = blink forward powerup

Story, Set amount of Stages Mode:
- There is a set amount of stages, each stage has a different set of colors
- Each stage should probably have two different color powerups that mix your colors together to form a new complementary color, changes the background as well. 
- If we have just two colors per stage (ideal imo), we shouldnt have obstacles in the middle of the stage that get rid of your color bc that would nerf and ruin the color appeal of the game. You should have both to fight the boss at the end so at the end of the level after you beat the boss, the camera turns back and shows how your color has affected the black background of the world while you have progressed
- At the last stage with the final boss, all of the colors you have gathered combine to form a rainbow aura, maybe with a unique shape as well like angelic wings, you get powerup moveset that maybe incorporates everything to fight the final boss which would be the tankiest (the last boss should be pitch black since thats what you are fighting against with the color idea)

- This next point is really optional, and I personally think it's not a good idea, and it would take more time and might ruin the simplicity of the game design but we could go for a detailed background instead of just solid color. If we have that set amount of stages and know which two colors will be present in the stage you are playing (even if they are in random order), we can generate different terrain/background depending on which two colors are in that stage. For example if the two colors in that stage are red and blue, the red part can be a sunsetish desert, or if you get blue first it can be an underwater look, and once you get violet/purple after mixing the two the background can be a cyberpunk looking city. However once again it would ruin the simple look of the game and it would take more effort than needed. I think a simple looking plain canvas would look nice



Infinite scrolling mode:
- One stage procedurally generated that continues on
- Obstacles can get remove a color from your aura
- Maybe all colors gone = death, have death traps as well as obstacles
- We can def incorporate more than two colors per stage here, if you get more than two then it would just boost the size/shape/vibrancy-of-color of your current aura and maybe make your powerup more powerful
